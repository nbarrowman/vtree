## Please note
This is a small update because a paper about this package has been accepted by the Journal of Statistical Software (JSS). The citation is included. Some other small changes are also there.

## Test environments
I used win-builder.r-project.org to successfully test R-oldrelease, R-release, and R-devel.
There was one note that the doi for the JSS paper was "possibly invalid", but it is the doi provided by the journal, and the paper will soon be published.

I used R-hub v2 to successfully test on several environments, including linux, m1-san, macos,windows, atlas, and c23.
 
## R CMD check results (running locally)
There were no errors or warnings.
There was one note about a non-standard file in the check directory, but that was because we are using NFS on our system (see https://serverfault.com/questions/201294/nfsxxxx-files-appearing-what-are-those)
