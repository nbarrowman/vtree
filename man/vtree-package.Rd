\title{vtree: a tool for calculating and drawing variable trees.}
\description{
vtree is a flexible tool for generating variable trees —
diagrams that display information about nested subsets of a data frame.
Given simple specifications,
the \code{vtree} function produces these diagrams and automatically
labels them with counts, percentages, and other summaries.

With vtree, you can:
\itemize{
  \item explore a data set interactively, and 
  \item produce customized figures for reports and publications.
}

For a comprehensive introduction see the \href{../doc/vtree.html}{vignette}.
